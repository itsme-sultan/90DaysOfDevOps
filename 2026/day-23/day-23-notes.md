# Day 23 – Git Branching & Working with GitHub

### Task 1: Understanding Branches
1. What is a branch in Git?
   - A branch is like a separate timeline of your project.
   - Think of it as a copy of the code where you can work on new features.
     
3. Why do we use branches instead of committing everything to `main`?
   - You can test features or fixes without breaking the main code.
   - Different people can work on different branches at the same time.
     
5. What is `HEAD` in Git?
   - `HEAD` is a special pointer that tells you where you currently are in your project’s history.
   - It always points to the latest commit on the branch you are working on.
     
7. What happens to your files when you switch branches?
   - Git updates your working directory and replaced with the versions from the branch you switched to.

### Task 2: Branching Commands — Hands-On
In your `devops-git-practice` repo, perform the following:
1. List all branches in your repo
2. Create a new branch called `feature-1`
3. Switch to `feature-1`
4. Create a new branch and switch to it in a single command — call it `feature-2`
5. Try using `git switch` to move between branches — how is it different from `git checkout`?
6. Make a commit on `feature-1` that does **not** exist on `main`
7. Switch back to `main` — verify that the commit from `feature-1` is not there
8. Delete a branch you no longer need
9. Add all branching commands to your `git-commands.md`

### Task 3: Push to GitHub
1. Create a **new repository** on GitHub (do NOT initialize it with a README)
2. Connect your local `devops-git-practice` repo to the GitHub remote
3. Push your `main` branch to GitHub
4. Push `feature-1` branch to GitHub
5. Verify both branches are visible on GitHub
6. Answer in your notes: What is the difference between `origin` and `upstream`?

---

### Task 4: Pull from GitHub
1. Make a change to a file **directly on GitHub** (use the GitHub editor)
2. Pull that change to your local repo
3. Answer in your notes: What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`?

---

### Task 5: Clone vs Fork
1. **Clone** any public repository from GitHub to your local machine
2. **Fork** the same repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
3. Answer in your notes:
   - What is the difference between clone and fork?
   - When would you clone vs fork?
   - After forking, how do you keep your fork in sync with the original repo?
